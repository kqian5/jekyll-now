Wow! Welcome to my website/blog.

I was born in Texas and moved to Georgia when I was young. (forgot how old lol) Currently, I'm in Providence, Rhode Island, where I am a second year student at Brown University concentrating in applied math-computer science. I am a lifelong learner and am committed to making an impact in the world.

In my free time you can find me on the courts practicing to be the next NBA star, attempting to play the violin, or sampling different foods.

Check out what I'm doing on [github](https://github.com/kqian5)!
