Hey! Welcome to my website.

I was born in Texas and moved to Georgia when I was young. (I actually forgot how old I was.) Currently, I'm in Providence, Rhode Island, where I am a second year student at Brown University concentrating in applied math-computer science. 

In my free time you can find me on the courts practicing to be the next NBA star, attempting to play the violin, or sampling different foods.

Check out what I'm doing on [github](https://github.com/kqian5)!
